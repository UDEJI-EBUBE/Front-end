## Getting Started with HTML
### TAGS
The thing I learnt in H2ML today is about tags. There are two types of tags. There are the ***empty*** tags, there are the container tags.
- First, the container tags has two <><>,e.g<br>
paragraph tag:`<p></p>`<br>
Heading tag: `<h1></h1>`It ranges from h1 to h6<br>
Button tag: `<button></button>`

- While the empty tags has only one <>. Any information that you want to store in an empty tag has to be in the <>.<br>
We have the <br>
Image tag: this is an empty tag <img src=""><br>
Break tag `<br>`: this is used to move to another line 
E.g 
`<p>Welcome to my <br> anime world</p>`

Just as in other programming languages we can also add comments in html with
`<!--...-->`
